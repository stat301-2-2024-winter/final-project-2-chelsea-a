## Overview

Directory contains figures, plots, a confusion matrix, and tables from scripts used for visualization of models. 

- `roc_auc_tbl`: ROC AUC table of all tuned/fitted models
- `correlation_plot`: correlation plot of predictor variables in the data with edited variable names
- `conf_mat`: confusion matrix of final fitted model
- `acc_table`: accuracy table of all tuned/fitted models
- `accuracy_plot`: accuracy table of all tuned/fitted models
- `count_plot`: distribution of target variable with bar plot
- `final_model_accuracy`: accuracy of winning model
- `final_model_rocauc`: ROC AUC of winning model
- `important`: plot showing most important predictors
- `student_curve`: the roc curve of the final fitted model
