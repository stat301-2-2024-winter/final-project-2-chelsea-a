## Memo format

Like all other submissions for this course, we expect the memo to be neat and well organized. This a template to get you started. 

You should make this document your own. To help with this we have added a date to the yaml above (good whenever writing memos). You should remove this block when making this document your own.

## Github Repo Link

To link to your github **repo**sitory, appropriately edit the example link below. Meaning replace `https://your-github-repo-url` with your github repo url. Suggest verifying the link works before submitting.

[https://your-github-repo-url](https://github.com/stat301-2-2024-winter/final-project-2-chelsea-a)

::: {.callout-warning}
GitHub (free account) cannot store large files. If you try to commit and push a large dataset you will have an ERROR! Any file over 100 MB (100,000 KB) needs to be added to the `.gitignore` file BEFORE committing.

**We may need to do that for files in your final project!**

## Data source

My data came from Kaggle and is called [Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023). In the dataaset there is one csv file called spotify-2023.csv.

## Why this data

I chose this data because I am a very active listener of Spotify and in 2023, my Spotify wrapped stated that I streamed 45,546 minutes of music.^[another footnote] I am a big fan of music and like discovering different kinds of music. I like to attend concerts and sometimes festivals in my free time.

This dataset has 22 variables.
