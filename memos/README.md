## Overview

Directory contains figures, a confusion matrix, and tables from scripts used for visualization of models.

- `roc_auc_tbl`: roc auc table of all tuned/fitted models
- `correlation_plot`: original correlation plot of predictor variables in the data 
- `correlation_plot2`: correlation plot of predictor variables in the data with edited variable names
- `conf_mat`: confusion matrix of final fitted model
- `acc_table`: accuracy table of all tuned/fitted models
