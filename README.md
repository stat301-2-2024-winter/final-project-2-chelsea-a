## Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for a multiclass classification task to predict whether an undergraduate student drops out, graduates, or remains enrolled in the institution. Utilizing data from a higher education institution in Portugal, I build several models to find the best model for predicting student outcomes. The project involves the creation of recipes, fitting/tuning models, fitting the best model, and model analysis. 

### Directories
